 * @coinsori-strategy v1
 * name: XRP 1D ATR-Adaptive Keltner Mean Reversion
 * ex: binance
 * syms: XRPUSDT
 * interval: 1d
 * cash: 10000
 *
 * Why this strategy: The ATR-adaptive Keltner mean-reversion recipe is the single
 * most robust edge in this ledger — positive on ~29/32 walk-forward windows across
 * 11 assets (BTC/ETH/SOL/LINK/ADA/BNB/DOGE). XRP is a large-cap alt that flushes
 * hard then snaps back, exactly the regime this family exploits, and it has not yet
 * been covered by this recipe. An ATR-adaptive lower band (EMA20 - 2.5x ATR) widens
 * the buy zone automatically in volatile regimes so we avoid catching falling knives.
 * When it buys and sells: Buys when price closes below the ATR-adaptive lower Keltner
 * band with RSI oversold (below 40) while price is above a rising 200-day average,
 * using nearly full cash. Sells on the snap-back above the mid band (EMA20) or when
 * RSI climbs above 60.
 * When it does NOT work: In a broad crypto bear XRP falls with everything and the
 * 200-day gate keeps us out of most trades (capital-preserving but captures little).
 * It badly lags buy-and-hold in a relentless melt-up because it sits in cash waiting
 * for a pullback. MDD is low but a gap can still hurt.
