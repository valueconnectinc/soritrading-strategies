 * @coinsori-strategy v1
 * name: XRP 1D Donchian Trend-Follower
 * ex: binance
 * syms: XRPUSDT
 * interval: 1d
 * cash: 10000
 *
 * Why this strategy: The ledger is clear that trend-following fails on BTC 1D but XRP
 * "trends hard and doesn't mean-revert cleanly" — it is the opposite asset type, so the
 * trend/breakout family is the right edge there. This is the classic turtle-style Donchian
 * breakout: ride sustained moves, cut losses when the move dies.
 * When it buys and sells: Buy when the close breaks above the 55-day high while the 200-day
 * average is still rising (we only chase breakouts inside a confirmed uptrend). Sell the
 * whole position when the close falls back below the 30-day low.
 * When it does NOT work: In a long sideways chop the 55-day-high breakout whipsaws and the
 * 30-day-low exit gives back most of each move. It also misses any rally that grinds up
 * slowly without fresh 55-day highs. Expect deep drawdowns in choppy bear recoveries.
