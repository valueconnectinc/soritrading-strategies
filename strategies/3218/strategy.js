 * @coinsori-strategy v1
 * name: On-Chain Network Growth BTC 1D
 * ex: binance
 * syms: BTCUSDT
 * interval: 1d
 * cash: 10000
 *
 * Why this strategy: Bitcoin's active-address count is a proxy for real network usage;
 * sustained growth in active addresses has historically coincided with price gains.
 * When it buys and sells: it stays LONG while the current active-address count is above
 * its 30-day average (network growing). It sells back to cash when addresses fall below
 * their 30-day average (network contracting).
 * When it does NOT work: in a bull market driven purely by macro liquidity (no new users)
 * addresses can stay flat while price runs — this strategy sits out those rallies. It also
 * lags sharp crashes because address data moves slowly.
