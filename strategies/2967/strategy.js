 * @coinsori-strategy v1
 * name: DOGE 1D ATR-Adaptive Keltner MR (Full-Cash)
 * ex: binance
 * syms: DOGEUSDT
 * interval: 1d
 * cash: 10000
 *
 * Why this strategy: The ATR-adaptive Keltner mean-reversion recipe is the one
 * robust edge in this ledger — positive on nearly every window across 9+ assets.
 * This DOGE 1D version keeps the exact proven entry/exit but sizes each entry with
 * nearly full cash. The ledger showed the previous 1.5%-risk-per-trade ATR sizing
 * starved the returns (cut a +254% window to +13%) while only trimming MDD from
 * 13% to 2% — a terrible trade-off for a strategy whose entries are rare.
 * When it buys and sells: Buys an oversold flush below the ATR-adaptive lower Keltner
 * band (EMA20 - 2.5x ATR) with RSI<40 inside a rising 200-day uptrend, using nearly
 * full cash. Sells on snap-back above the mid band (EMA20) or RSI above 60.
 * When it does NOT work: In a broad bear DOGE falls hardest and the 200-day gate keeps
 * it out of most trades (capital-preserving but captures little). It lags buy-and-hold
 * in a relentless meme melt-up because it sits in cash waiting for a pullback. MDD is
 * low (single digits to ~13%) but a meme asset can still gap; this is not a melt-up
 * capture machine.
