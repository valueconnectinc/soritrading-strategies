 * @coinsori-strategy v1
 * name: SOL 1D ATR-Adaptive Keltner MR (Vol-Scaled)
 * ex: binance
 * syms: SOLUSDT
 * interval: 1d
 * cash: 10000
 *
 * Why this strategy: same ATR-adaptive Keltner mean-reversion recipe as the
 * validated SOL 1D champion, but with volatility-scaled position sizing. The
 * champion's one weak point is high drawdown on high-beta SOL (39% on the
 * 2020-22 window) from full-cash sizing. Scaling the position down when ATR is
 * wide (violent regime) and up when ATR is narrow keeps each trade's daily
 * volatility exposure roughly constant, which should cut drawdown without
 * giving up the defensive edge.
 * When it buys and sells: buys when price closes below the ATR-adaptive lower
 * Keltner band (EMA20 - 2.5x ATR) with RSI oversold while price is above a
 * rising 200-day average, sized so the trade risks a target fraction of equity
 * per ATR. Sells on the snap-back above the mid band (EMA20) or RSI above 60.
 * When it does NOT work: in a broad crypto bear the 200-day gate keeps us out
 * of most trades (capital-preserving), and it lags buy-and-hold in relentless
 * melt-ups because it sits in cash waiting for a pullback.
