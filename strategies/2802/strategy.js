/*
 * @coinsori-strategy v1
 * name: SOL 1D Fed-Funds Rate Regime Gate
 * ex: binance
 * syms: SOLUSDT
 * interval: 1d
 * cash: 10000
 *
 * Why this strategy: The monetary-policy regime gate was validated on Bitcoin
 * and Ethereum 1D — hold while the central bank is not aggressively hiking,
 * move to cash in a tightening cycle. This is an out-of-sample test of whether
 * that macro signal generalizes to a third crypto asset (Solana), which is
 * younger and more volatile than BTC/ETH.
 * When it buys and sells: stays invested in SOL as long as the fed funds rate
 * is not more than ~0.5pp above where it was ~30 days earlier; sells to cash
 * when the rate jumps that much (a real hiking step) and waits for it to stop.
 * When it does NOT work: it rides full SOL drawdowns during non-hiking periods
 * (no price stop, only the policy gate), and SOL is far more volatile than
 * BTC/ETH so those drawdowns can be very deep; it also misses melt-ups if the
 * gate keeps it out too long after a hiking cycle ends.
