/*
 * @coinsori-strategy v1
 * name: SOL Defensive Mean-Reversion 1D
 * ex: binance
 * syms: SOLUSDT
 * interval: 1d
 * cash: 10000
 *
 * Why this strategy: SOL tends to snap back up after sharp, oversold panic drops
 * when its long-term trend is still intact. Buying those deep dips and selling
 * after a recovery is a defensive way to profit without chasing melt-ups.
 * When it buys and sells: it buys only when price closes below the lower Bollinger
 * band with RSI very oversold, and only while the 200-day average is still rising.
 * It sells once price climbs back above its 20-day average (recovered) or the
 * long-term trend rolls over.
 * When it does NOT work: in a straight-line melt-up it stays mostly flat (few deep
 * dips to buy) and lags buy-and-hold; in a sustained bear the trend gate keeps it
 * in cash so it protects capital but earns little. It is defensive, not a momentum
 * winner.
