 * @coinsori-strategy v1
 * name: SOL 1D ATR-Adaptive Keltner Mean Reversion
 * ex: binance
 * syms: SOLUSDT
 * interval: 1d
 * cash: 10000
 *
 * Why this strategy: SOL is a high-beta alt that pulls back hard and snaps back
 * fast, which is exactly the regime mean reversion exploits. Instead of a fixed
 * Bollinger band, this uses an ATR-adaptive lower Keltner band (EMA20 minus 2.5x
 * ATR), so the buy zone widens automatically when volatility is high — avoiding
 * catching a falling knife in violent regimes. A rising 200-day average gates the
 * entries so we only buy fear inside a healthy long-term uptrend. This is the
 * same family that has been positive on ~29/32 windows across 11 assets.
 * When it buys and sells: Buys when price closes below the ATR-adaptive lower
 * Keltner band with RSI oversold (below 40) while price is above a rising 200-day
 * average, using nearly full cash. Sells on the snap-back above the mid band
 * (EMA20) or when RSI climbs above 60.
 * When it does NOT work: In a broad crypto bear (like 2022) SOL falls with
 * everything else and the 200-day gate keeps us out of most trades, so we lose
 * little but also miss nothing — it is capital-preserving. It badly lags a pure
 * buy-and-hold in relentless melt-ups because it sits in cash waiting for a pullback.
