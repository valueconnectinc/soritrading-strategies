 * @coinsori-strategy v1
 * name: BTC 1D On-Chain Network-Health Trend
 * ex: binance
 * syms: BTCUSDT
 * interval: 1d
 * cash: 10000
 *
 * Why this strategy: BTC's on-chain activity (daily active addresses) is a
 * network-health fundamental. When the number of active addresses is growing,
 * real users are transacting and the network is expanding — historically a
 * supportive backdrop for price. This is an on-chain family, different from
 * price-only mean reversion and from sentiment. It uses the user's own
 * active-addresses dataset (verified available).
 * When it buys and sells: Enters long when the 30-day average of active
 * addresses is rising (network expanding) AND price is above its 200-day
 * average (trend intact). Exits when the address trend turns down (network
 * contracting) or price breaks below the 50-day average. Otherwise in cash.
 * When it does NOT work: Active addresses can rise while price is flat or
 * falling (network use is not the same as price momentum), and address growth
 * lags price moves. In a bull market driven purely by speculation with flat
 * on-chain activity, this stays out and underperforms.
