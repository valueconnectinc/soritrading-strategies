 * @coinsori-strategy v1
 * name: BTC 1D Fed-Gate + Trend Defense (two-state)
 * ex: binance
 * syms: BTCUSDT
 * interval: 1d
 * cash: 10000
 *
 * Why this strategy: The pure fed-funds gate holds Bitcoin while the central
 * bank is not actively hiking, but it rides full drawdowns whenever the Fed
 * is on hold (e.g. 2019, 2025 bears). This version keeps the monetary-policy
 * gate AND adds a slow trend defense: it fully exits to cash when price is
 * below its 200-day average even if the Fed is not hiking. It is deliberately
 * TWO-STATE (all in or all out) with no fractional rebalancing, so it does not
 * churn on fees like earlier position-scaling variants.
 * When it buys and sells: it is fully in Bitcoin only when the fed funds rate
 * is not aggressively rising AND price is above its 200-day average. It sells
 * to cash when either condition fails (hiking, or price below the 200-day).
 * It re-enters only when both conditions are met again.
 * When it does NOT work: a sharp V-shaped recovery where price is still below
 * the 200-day at the bottom means it misses the first leg up (the 200-day lags
 * in fast rebounds). And it still has no intra-trend stop, so a slow bleed
 * above the 200-day still draws down.
