/*
 * @coinsori-strategy v1
 * name: SOL 1D Vol-Scaled Mean Reversion
 * ex: binance
 * syms: SOLUSDT
 * interval: 1d
 * cash: 10000
 *
 * Why this strategy: SOL's daily chart repeatedly overshoots to the downside
 * during panic (wide Bollinger band, deeply oversold RSI) and then snaps back
 * toward its average. Buying these panic dips and letting the snap-back happen
 * is a classic mean-reversion trade, common in volatile altcoins.
 * When it buys and sells: it buys when price touches the lower Bollinger band
 * AND RSI is below 30 (deep oversold), sizing the position smaller when
 * volatility (ATR) is high. It sells when price climbs back above the middle
 * band (mean reversion complete) or RSI recovers above 55.
 * When it does NOT work: in a sustained bear market the price keeps falling
 * through the lower band and "catching the knife" loses money — this strategy
 * needs mean-reversion to win, not a one-way downtrend.
