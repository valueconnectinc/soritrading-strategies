 * @coinsori-strategy v1
 * name: Trend-Gated Vol-Target CrashStop LINK 1D
 * ex: binance
 * syms: LINKUSDT
 * interval: 1d
 * cash: 10000
 *
 * Why this strategy: A volatility-targeting family (distinct from the OBV trend
 * and Keltner mean-reversion champions). It stays fully invested while the trend
 * is up, scales to a fixed daily-volatility target in a mild downtrend, and
 * exits fully to cash on a genuine crash. This continuously de-risks in choppy
 * or falling markets while participating in uptrends — a defensive signature
 * that was validated on BTC/ETH/SOL/XRP/BNB 1d. This tests whether it
 * generalizes to a fresh asset (LINK).
 * When it buys and sells: above the 50-day average = fully invested; below it
 * but within an ATR-scaled band = size to a 2% daily vol target; beyond 3.0
 * ATRs below the average = fully to cash (crash stop).
 * When it does NOT work: in a violent V-shaped recovery it can sell near the
 * bottom and miss the bounce; LINK's higher volatility means deeper drawdowns
 * in sharp bull corrections than the majors.
