 * @coinsori-strategy v1
 * name: BTC 1D Bollinger-RSI Defensive Mean Reversion
 * ex: binance
 * syms: BTCUSDT
 * interval: 1d
 * cash: 10000
 *
 * Why this strategy: The ledger shows mean reversion is the ONLY validated edge on
 * BTC 1D (every trend/momentum family failed, including all-in trend capture and a
 * 40% baseline long — both lost money this cycle). This is a defensive mean-reversion
 * flavor: buy a deep oversold flush to the lower Bollinger band with RSI crushed, but
 * ONLY inside a healthy long-term uptrend so we never catch a falling knife in a broad
 * bear. Uses only core indicators (Bollinger, RSI, ATR, SMA) that are always available.
 * It trades rarely — that is the point: defensive MR wins because it stays flat and
 * avoids the whipsaw that every trend mode produces on crypto 1D.
 * When it buys and sells: Buys when price closes below the lower Bollinger band (20, 2.5)
 * with RSI below 30, while price is above a rising 200-day average, sized by ATR risk
 * (1% of equity) capped at 90% of cash. Sells on the snap-back above the 20-day average
 * or when RSI climbs above 55.
 * When it does NOT work: In a broad crypto bear the 200-day gate keeps us out of most
 * trades (capital-preserving but captures little). It lags buy-and-hold in a relentless
 * melt-up because it sits in cash waiting for a pullback — every attempt to add trend
 * capture to fix this has lost money, so this is accepted as the honest trade-off.
 * Low trade count means the edge depends on the few flushes that actually mark a bottom.
