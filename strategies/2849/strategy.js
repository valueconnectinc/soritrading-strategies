 * ex: binance
 * syms: BTCUSDT
 * interval: 1d
 * cash: 10000
 *
 * Why this strategy: Bitcoin is a high-beta risk asset that historically
 * struggles during Fed tightening cycles (rising policy rates drain
 * liquidity) and thrives when the Fed is on hold or easing. This bets on
 * the monetary-policy regime: stay long while the Fed is not hiking, step
 * aside when a tightening cycle begins. It uses the fed funds rate compared
 * to its level 30 days ago to detect the onset of a hike quickly.
 * When it buys and sells: stays long while the current fed funds rate is
 * not above its level 30 days ago (no tightening); sells when the rate has
 * risen over the last 30 days (hiking has begun).
 * When it does NOT work: crypto can rally hard even while the Fed hikes
 * (e.g. liquidity-driven melt-ups), so this can sit out strong bulls. And
 * the 30-day comparison can be slow to flip back after a hike ends. It is a
 * slow, macro-frequency signal with genuinely high drawdowns when it is long
 * during a non-hiking bear.
