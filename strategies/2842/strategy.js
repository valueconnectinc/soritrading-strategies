/*
 * @coinsori-strategy v1
 * name: On-Chain Demand Trend BTC 1D
 * ex: binance
 * syms: BTCUSDT
 * interval: 1d
 * cash: 10000
 *
 * Why this strategy: Bitcoin's on-chain active-address count is a leading
 * indicator of network adoption and demand. When smoothed active addresses
 * are rising, buyers are entering the network and price tends to follow;
 * when they are contracting, demand is leaving and price tends to weaken.
 * This bets directly on that on-chain demand trend rather than on price.
 * When it buys and sells: buys when smoothed active addresses are rising
 * (current > ~30 bars ago with 0.3% hysteresis) and stays long while that
 * trend holds; sells when the demand trend turns down.
 * When it does NOT work: on-chain demand and price can diverge for long
 * stretches (e.g. a melt-up with flat addresses, or a flush with addresses
 * still high), so this can be late into rallies or exit too early. It is a
 * slow, low-frequency signal — do not expect it to catch sharp moves.
