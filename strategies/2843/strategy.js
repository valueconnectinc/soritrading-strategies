 * name: Hashrate Regime Gate BTC 1D
 * ex: binance
 * syms: BTCUSDT
 * interval: 1d
 * cash: 10000
 *
 * Why this strategy: Bitcoin mining hashrate is slow-moving and smooth —
 * it reflects the long-run health and security of the network. When
 * hashrate is in an uptrend, miners are confident and the network is
 * growing; that is a favorable regime for price. This uses hashrate as a
 * SLOW regime gate (not a noisy per-bar trigger), then confirms with price
 * trend before going long.
 * When it buys and sells: goes long only when BOTH hashrate is trending up
 * (above its 30-day average) AND price is above its 50-day average. Sells
 * when either condition breaks.
 * When it does NOT work: hashrate is a lagging, low-frequency signal, so it
 * is late into new uptrends and slow to exit — it can give back gains in
 * sharp reversals and misses fast initial rallies. In a flat market it may
 * churn between the two conditions.
