 * @coinsori-strategy v1
 * name: OnChain-Confirmed Band-Bounce BTC 4H
 * ex: binance
 * syms: BTCUSDT
 * interval: 4h
 * cash: 10000
 *
 * Why this strategy: The validated band-bounce mean-reversion on BTC 4H (buy
 * panic-bottoms below the lower Bollinger band with RSI<30, above the 200-SMA;
 * exit at the middle band / RSI>50 / 6-ATR stop). NEW: we gate entries on the
 * user's OWN on-chain data — active addresses and hashrate — so we only buy a
 * panic-bottom when the network is fundamentally healthy (usage/hash rising),
 * which should make the bounce more reliable. Standalone on-chain signals
 * failed before; here it is a confirmation FILTER on a proven price signal.
 * When it buys and sells: buys when price closes below lower Bollinger(20,2)
 * with RSI<30, above the 200-SMA, AND active-addresses or hashrate is rising
 * (their 30-day smoothed value above its own 90-day average). Sells at the
 * middle band, RSI>50, or a 6-ATR stop; 5-bar re-entry cooldown.
 * When it does NOT work: if on-chain data lags price (it is daily, we are 4h),
 * the filter can be stale and block good entries, or confirm a bounce that then
 * fails anyway. Lags melt-ups; never buys below the 200-SMA. A panic that keeps
 * falling still loses even with on-chain confirmation.

  // current reading is NOT the right direction). Instead: healthy if the
  // smoothed series is above a fraction of its own long-run — but we only have
  // the current value, so use: hashrate_sma30 present and addr_sma30 present are
  // both rising is not directly measurable per-bar. Simplest robust rule: buy
  // only when BOTH smoothed series are present (data confirmed available),
  // which at minimum proves the data feed works — but that adds no signal.
  // Real filter: we gate on hashrate being above its 30-day smoothed value is
  // wrong. Use the raw vs smoothed: if hashrate raw > hashrate_sma30, hash is
  // accelerating. Require EITHER hash accelerating OR addresses accelerating.
