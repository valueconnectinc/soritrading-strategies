 * @coinsori-strategy v1
 * name: On-Chain Demand Trend BTC 1D
 * ex: binance
 * syms: BTCUSDT
 * interval: 1d
 * cash: 10000
 *
 * Why this strategy: Bitcoin's on-chain active-address count is a leading
 * indicator of network adoption and demand. When smoothed active addresses
 * are rising, buyers are entering the network and price tends to follow;
 * when they are contracting, demand is leaving and price tends to weaken.
 * This bets directly on that on-chain demand trend rather than on price.
 * It requires BOTH active addresses AND mining hashrate to be rising, so
 * the long regime is only entered when the whole network is growing.
 * When it buys and sells: buys when both smoothed active addresses and
 * hashrate are rising (current > ~30 bars ago with 0.3% hysteresis) and
 * stays long while that joint trend holds; sells when either turns down.
 * When it does NOT work: on-chain demand and price can diverge for long
 * stretches (e.g. a melt-up with flat addresses, or a flush with addresses
 * still high), so this can be late into rallies or exit too early. Requiring
 * both signals also makes it even more conservative — it can miss rallies
 * driven by only one of the two. It is a slow, low-frequency signal.
