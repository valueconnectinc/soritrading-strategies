 * name: Defensive Mean Reversion BTC 4h
 * ex: upbit
 * syms: BTC
 * interval: 4h
 * cash: 10000000
 *
 * Why this strategy: BTC tends to snap back up after sharp, oversold flush drops when
 * the long-term trend is still intact. Buying those panic dips and selling after a
 * recovery is a defensive way to profit without chasing melt-ups.
 * When it buys and sells: it buys only when price is far below its long-term (200-day)
 * average AND RSI is very oversold (deep dip). It sells once price climbs back above its
 * short average (recovered) or when the long-term trend turns down.
 * When it does NOT work: in a long melt-up it stays mostly flat (few dips to buy) and
 * lags buy-and-hold; in a sustained bear market the trend gate keeps it mostly in cash
 * so it protects capital but makes little. It is defensive, not a momentum winner.
