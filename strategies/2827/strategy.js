/*
 * @coinsori-strategy v1
 * name: Composite On-Chain Demand BTC 1D
 * ex: binance
 * syms: BTCUSDT
 * interval: 1d
 * cash: 10000
 *
 * Why this strategy: Two independent on-chain fundamentals — active network
 * addresses (user demand) and miner hashrate (producer commitment) — each rise
 * in healthy bull phases and stall or fall in capitulation. Requiring BOTH to
 * confirm is a stronger, more selective signal than either alone, and selling
 * when EITHER turns down exits faster than a single-signal version — targeting
 * the family's known weakness of lagging price in bears (high drawdown).
 * When it buys and sells: holds Bitcoin only while BOTH the 30-day-smoothed
 * active-address count AND the 30-day-smoothed hashrate are rising vs ~30 days
 * earlier. Sells to cash when EITHER signal turns down.
 * When it does NOT work: on-chain data is daily and lags price, so in a sharp
 * V-shaped melt-up it re-enters late and trails buy-and-hold; and requiring both
 * signals means it is fully out during mixed regimes where only one is rising.
