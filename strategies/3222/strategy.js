/*
 * @coinsori-strategy v1
 * name: BNB 1D Momentum + Fed Filter
 * ex: binance
 * syms: BNBUSDT
 * interval: 1d
 * cash: 10000
 *
 * Why this strategy: the 90-day momentum + 200-day average core is the validated
 * champion on BTC/ETH/SOL and just held up on BNB. Adding the Fed not-hiking
 * filter (the champion's proven improvement) targets the 2018/2022 crypto bears,
 * which were both Fed-hiking periods — BNB's worst drawdowns.
 * When it buys and sells: buys when 90-day momentum is above +20%, price is above
 * the 200-day average, AND the Fed is not hiking. Sells when momentum fades below
 * +5% or price breaks the 200-day average.
 * When it does NOT work: in a Fed-easing regime that is still a crypto bear (late
 * 2018) the filter cannot help, and it can lag a raging bull by waiting for the
 * 200-day break. Single-symbol means no diversification across coins.
