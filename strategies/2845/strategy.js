 * @coinsori-strategy v1
 * name: Funding OI Contrarian BTC Futures 1D
 * ex: binance
 * syms: BTCUSDT
 * interval: 1d
 * cash: 10000
 *
 * Why this strategy: In perpetual futures, the funding rate is a direct
 * measure of crowding. When funding is strongly positive, longs are paying
 * shorts and the market is crowded long — a squeeze down is more likely.
 * When funding is strongly negative, shorts are paying longs and the market
 * is washed out — a bounce is more likely. Open interest tells us whether
 * that crowding is building (fresh leverage) or unwinding. This bets that
 * extreme positioning mean-reverts.
 * When it buys and sells: buys when funding is deeply negative (shorts
 * crowded) and open interest is not still ballooning; sells/exits when
 * funding turns strongly positive (longs crowded) or stays neutral.
 * When it does NOT work: in a strong one-way trend, crowded positioning can
 * stay crowded and keep running (a melt-up with positive funding, a crash
 * with negative funding) — contrarian entries get run over. It is a
 * mean-reversion bet, so it is wrong exactly when the trend is strongest.
