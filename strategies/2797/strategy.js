/*
 * @coinsori-strategy v1
 * name: BTC 1D Fed-Funds Rate Regime Gate
 * ex: binance
 * syms: BTCUSDT
 * interval: 1d
 * cash: 10000
 *
 * Why this strategy: A genuinely different signal source — monetary policy
 * instead of price. When the central bank is actively RAISING rates (a
 * tightening cycle) risk assets like crypto tend to fall; when it is cutting
 * or holding, liquidity supports them. This strategy holds Bitcoin while the
 * fed funds rate is NOT aggressively rising, and moves to cash when the Fed
 * is clearly tightening. It is a slow, low-turnover macro regime switch.
 * When it buys and sells: it stays invested in BTC as long as the fed funds
 * rate is not more than ~0.5 percentage points above where it was roughly a
 * month earlier. When the rate has jumped that much (a real hiking step), it
 * sells to cash and waits until the rate stops rising.
 * When it does NOT work: it rides full market drawdowns during non-hiking
 * periods (it has no price stop, only the policy gate), so a crypto crash
 * that happens while the Fed is on hold hits it fully. It also misses
 * melt-ups if the gate keeps it out too long after a hiking cycle ends.
