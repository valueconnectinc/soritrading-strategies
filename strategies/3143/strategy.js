/*
 * @coinsori-strategy v1
 * name: ADA 1D Donchian Breakout Trend
 * ex: binance
 * syms: ADAUSDT
 * interval: 1d
 * cash: 10000
 *
 * Why this strategy: Assets that break out of a long consolidation range often
 * keep trending for weeks. A Donchian channel breakout (buy the highest high of
 * the last 55 days) catches these moves on ADA, the one asset where this recipe
 * held up in earlier testing (it failed on BTC/XRP/ETH). Trend-following is a
 * completely different family from the mean-reversion champions.
 * When it buys and sells: buys when the daily close breaks above the highest
 * high of the previous 55 days; sells when the close breaks below the lowest
 * low of the previous 30 days. Always fully in or fully out.
 * When it does NOT work: in long sideways/choppy markets the breakout whipsaws —
 * repeated false breakouts bleed small losses. It gives back part of the trend
 * on every pullback (the 30-day exit is slow). Do not expect it to beat a
 * strong buy-and-hold in a straight melt-up; it wins by avoiding the crashes.
 * Drawdowns are high (50-75%) because it rides volatile ADA down to its exit.
