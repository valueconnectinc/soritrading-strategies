 * ex: binance
 * syms: SOLUSDT
 * interval: 1d
 * cash: 10000
 *
 * Why this strategy: the defensive mean-reversion idea protects capital in bears but
 * lags badly in melt-ups. This is the opposite family — momentum/trend following —
 * that rides strong uptrends and lets winners run with a trailing stop.
 * When it buys and sells: buys only when the 200-day trend is up AND price is above
 * its 50-day average AND short-term momentum is strong (price at/near its 20-day
 * high); sells when price closes below the 50-day average or drops 2.5 ATR from its
 * running peak.
 * When it does NOT work: in a chop/sideways or sharp bear regime it still buys late
 * and gives back gains; it needs a real sustained directional move to pay off.
