/*
 * @coinsori-strategy v1
 * name: ETH 1D Fed-Funds Rate Regime Gate
 * ex: binance
 * syms: ETHUSDT
 * interval: 1d
 * cash: 10000
 *
 * Why this strategy: The same monetary-policy signal that was validated on
 * Bitcoin — hold while the central bank is not aggressively hiking, move to
 * cash in a tightening cycle. This tests whether that macro gate generalizes
 * to Ethereum. If the policy-driven liquidity regime is a real driver of
 * crypto risk appetite, it should help ETH the same way it helped BTC.
 * When it buys and sells: stays invested in ETH as long as the fed funds rate
 * is not more than ~0.5pp above where it was ~30 days earlier; sells to cash
 * when the rate jumps that much (a real hiking step) and waits for it to stop.
 * When it does NOT work: it rides full ETH drawdowns during non-hiking periods
 * (no price stop, only the policy gate), and ETH is more volatile than BTC so
 * those drawdowns can be deep; it also misses melt-ups if the gate keeps it
 * out too long after a hiking cycle ends.
