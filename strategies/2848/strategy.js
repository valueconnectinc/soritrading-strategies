 * ex: binance
 * syms: BTCUSDT
 * interval: 1d
 * cash: 10000
 *
 * Why this strategy: The Fear & Greed index (0-100) tracks crowd sentiment.
 * Instead of fading extremes (contrarian), this follows the sentiment TREND:
 * when the index is above its own moving average, sentiment is improving and
 * buying pressure tends to persist; when it drops below, sentiment is
 * deteriorating and price tends to weaken. This bets that sentiment momentum
 * persists, which is the opposite of the failed contrarian approach.
 * When it buys and sells: stays long while the fear-greed index is above its
 * 20-day average; steps aside when it falls below.
 * When it does NOT work: sentiment is a lagging, noisy measure — in a fast
 * crash the index can drop sharply (good exit) but in a slow grind it
 * whipsaws around its average, generating many small losing trades. It also
 * misses rallies that happen while sentiment stays flat.
