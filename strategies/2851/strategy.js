 * @coinsori-strategy v1
 * name: Fed Regime + OnChain Demand Overlay BTC 1D
 * ex: binance
 * syms: BTCUSDT
 * interval: 1d
 * cash: 10000
 *
 * Why this strategy: Bitcoin struggles during Fed tightening cycles (rising
 * rates drain liquidity) and thrives when the Fed is on hold or easing. This
 * stays long while the Fed is not hiking. To fix the pure-fed regime's high
 * drawdown (it rides non-hiking bears fully), it adds a defensive on-chain
 * overlay: if active network addresses are collapsing even while the Fed is
 * not hiking, the rally lacks fundamental support, so it exits to cut losses.
 * When it buys and sells: buys while the fed funds rate is not above its
 * level 30 days ago AND network demand is not collapsing; sells when a hike
 * begins OR network demand collapses during a non-hiking period.
 * When it does NOT work: crypto can melt up even while the Fed hikes
 * (liquidity-driven bulls), so it can sit out strong rallies. The on-chain
 * overlay can also exit too early in a genuine bull if a short address
 * dip occurs. It is a slow macro-frequency signal with genuine drawdowns.
