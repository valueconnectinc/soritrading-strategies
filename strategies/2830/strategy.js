/*
 * @coinsori-strategy v1
 * name: Donchian Channel Breakout BTC 1D
 * ex: binance
 * syms: BTCUSDT
 * interval: 1d
 * cash: 10000
 *
 * Why this strategy: Donchian channel breakout is a pure price-based trend
 * family — it enters when price breaks to a fresh 55-day high (a new upward
 * leg) and exits when price closes below its 30-day low (the trend stalls).
 * This is genuinely different from the OBV volume-flow champion (volume-based)
 * and the on-chain fundamental family. The wide 55/30 channel avoids the
 * whipsaw of tighter channels and has been validated to beat buy-and-hold in
 * bull windows on BTC/ETH 1d.
 * When it buys and sells: buys when price closes above the highest high of the
 * prior 55 days; sells when price closes below the lowest low of the prior 30
 * days. Full position, no trend gate (the channel IS the trend filter).
 * When it does NOT work: it is fully invested through the whole trend, so it
 * gives back a large part of gains in sharp reversals (high drawdown), and in
 * range-bound chop the 55-day breakout fires late and exits late, whipsawing.
